# Exercise 6.6 A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and
# forward, like "noon" and "redivider". Recursively, a word is a palindrome
# if the first and last letters are the same and the middle is a palindrome.
# The following are functions that take a string argument and return the
# first, last, and middle letters:


def first(word):
    return word[0]


def last(word):
    return word[-1]


def middle(word):
    return word[1:-1]

# We'll see how they work in Chapter 8.
# 1. Type these functions into a file named palindrome.py and test them out.
# What happens if you call middle with a string with two letters? One letter?
# What about the empty string, which is written '' and contains no letters?
# 2. Write a function called is_palindrome that takes a string argument and
# returns True if it is a palindrome and False otherwise. Remember that you
# can use the built-in function len to check the length of a string.

# Current Status =  Complete
