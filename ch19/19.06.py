# Use Tkinter to write a basic web browser. It should have a Text widget 
# where the user can enter a URL and a Canvas to display the contents of the 
# page.
# You can use the urllib module to download files (see Exercise 14.5) and the
# HTMLParser module to parse the HTML tags (see 
# docs.python.org/lib/module-HTMLParser.html).
# At a minimum your browser should handle plain text and hyperlinks. As a
# challenge you could handle background colors, text formatting tags and
# images.
