# Modify your solution to Exercise 19.2 by adding an Entry widget and a 
# second button. When the user presses the second button, it should read a
# color name from the Entry and use it to change the fill color of the circle.
# Use config to modify the existing circle; donâ€™t create a new one.
# Your program should handle the case where the user tries to change the color 
# of a circle that hasn't been created, and the case where the color name is 
# invalid. You can see my solution at thinkpython.com/code/circle_demo.py.

# Current Status: Incomplete
