# Here's another Car Talk Puzzler:
# "I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to notice
# my odometer. Like most odometers, it shows six digits, in whole miles
# only. So, if my car had 300,000 miles, for example, I'd see 3-0-0-0-0-0.
# "Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the last
# 4 digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as backward.
# For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer could have read
# 3-1-5-4-4-5. "One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For
# example, it could have read 3-6-5-4-5-6. One mile after that, the middle
# 4 out of 6 numbers were palindromic. And you ready for this? One mile later,
# all 6 were palindromic! "The question is, what was on the odometer when I
# first looked?"
# Write a Python program that tests all the six-digit numbers and prints any
# numbers that satisfy these requirements. You can see my solution at
# thinkpython.com/code/cartalk.py.

# Current Status: Complete

# My solution is much different from the authors solution. For exercise
# 9.7 I couldn't solve it and had to look at the authors and ended up with
# a solution that was almost identical. In this case I solved it independently
# and got something totally different.  I kind of like mine a little better
# since it's easier to follow the logic assuming the index notation doesn't
# throw you off. Simply put: check if each condition is true, if it is
# add another mile then move on to the next if statement until all conditions
# are met, then print the number minus the 3 added miles. The two values
# which satisfy the conditions are 198888 and 199999.
