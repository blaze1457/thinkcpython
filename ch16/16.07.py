# Write a class definition for a date object that has attributes day, month
# and year. Write a function called increment_date that takes a date object,
# date and an integer, n, and returns a new date object that represents the
# day n days after date. Hint: "Thirty days hath September..."
# Challenge: does your function deal with leap years correctly? See
# wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year.
