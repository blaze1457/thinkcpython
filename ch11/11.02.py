# Dictionaries have a method called get that takes a key and a default
# value. If the key appears in the dictionary, get returns the
# corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value.
# For example:
# >>> h = histogram('a')
# >>> print h
# {'a': 1}
# >>> h.get('a', 0)
# 1
# >>> h.get('b', 0)
# 0
# Use get to write histogram more concisely. You should be able to
# eliminate the if statement

# Current Status: Complete
