# World.py, which is part of Swampy (see Chapter 4), contains a class 
# definition for a user-defined type called World. You can import it like 
# this:
#
# from World import World
#
# This version of the import statement imports the World class from the
# World module. The following code creates a World object and calls the
# mainloop method, which waits for the user.
#
# world = World()
# world.mainloop()
#
# A window should appear with a title bar and an empty square. We will use
# this window to draw Points, Rectangles and other shapes. Add the 
# following lines before calling mainloop and run the program again.
#
# canvas = world.ca(width=500, height=500, background='white')
# bbox = [[-150,-100], [150, 100]]
# canvas.rectangle(bbox, outline='black', width=2, fill='green4')
#
# You should see a green rectangle with a black outline. The first line 
# creates a Canvas, which appears in the window as a white square. The Canvas
# object provides methods like rectangle for drawing various shapes. bbox is a
# list of lists that represents the "bounding box" of the rectangle. The first
# pair of coordinates is the lower-left corner of the rectangle; the second
# pair is the upper-right corner.
# You can draw a circle like this:
#
# canvas.circle([-25,0], 70, outline=None, fill='red')
#
# The first parameter is the coordinate pair for the center of the circle; 
# the second parameter is the radius.
# If you add this line to the program, the result should resemble the national
# flag of Bangladesh (see wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign-state_flags).
# 1. Write a function called draw_rectangle that takes a Canvas and a
# Rectangle as arguments and draws a representation of the Rectangle on the
# Canvas.
# 2. Add an attribute named color to your Rectangle objects and modify 
# draw_rectangle so that it uses the color attribute as the fill color.
# 3. Write a function called draw_point that takes a Canvas and a Point as 
# arguments and draws a representation of the Point on the Canvas.
# 4. Define a new class called Circle with appropriate attributes and 
# instantiate a few Circle objects.
# Write a function called draw_circle that draws circles on the canvas.
# 5. Write a program that draws the national flag of the Czech Republic.
# Hint: you can draw a polygon like this:
#
# points = [[-150,-100], [150, 100], [150, -100]]
# canvas.polygon(points, fill='blue')
# I have written a small program that lists the available colors; you can
# download it from
# thinkpython.com/code/color_list.py.
