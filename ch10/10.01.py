# Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the cumulative
# sum; that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the first
# i + 1 elements from the original list. For example, the cumulative sum
# of [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 6].

# Current Status: Complete

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    for i in numbers:
        total += i
        sums.append(total)
